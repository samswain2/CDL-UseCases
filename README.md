# CDL Industry Practicum Project: IoT Use Cases
This repository contains the implementation of three IoT use cases on AWS together with deliverables for the [practicum project](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/curriculum/descriptions/msia-489.html) in collaboration with the Center for Deep Learning (CDL) at Northwestern University. 

## Overview

### Center for Deep Learning
The Center for Deep Learningâ€™s mission is to act as a resource for companies seeking to establish or improve access to artificial intelligence (AI) by providing technical capacity and expertise. Their recent work include serving for deep learning, model architecture redesign, AI for IoT and general streaming, and prediction or scoring confidence. Please refer to the following [resource](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/) for more information regarding CDL. 

### REFIT



























 The project focuses on developing and implementing IoT use cases using REFIT, a system designed to consume and capitalize on IoT infrastructure, and comparing it with cloud platforms.

More [information](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/projects/refit) on REFIT.

### Objectives
1. Develop and implement 3 IoT use cases based on public data in REFIT
2. Implement the same use cases using one of the three big cloud providers
3. Design and implement a feature selection and engineering algorithm for time series data
4. Assess pros and cons of using REFIT vs cloud platforms

### Scope
- Implement the same 3 use cases in both REFIT and cloud platforms
- Develop and implement AI models for use cases
- Perform feature selection and engineering for time series data
- Create feature engineering algorithms for each use case

### Expectations
- Implement the project in Python or Scala
- Integrate feature engineering with the rest of REFIT
- Deliver feature engineering as a Docker container

### Contacts
- Point of contact: Borchuluun Yadamsuren
- Technical adviser: Diego Klabjan
- Supporting staff: Raman Khurana (post-doc at CD)
