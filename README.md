# CDL Industry Practicum Project: IoT Use Cases
This repository contains the implementation of three IoT use cases on AWS together with deliverables for the [practicum project](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/curriculum/descriptions/msia-489.html) in collaboration with the Center for Deep Learning (CDL) at Northwestern University.

## Overview

### Center for Deep Learning
The Center for Deep Learningâ€™s mission is to act as a resource for companies seeking to establish or improve access to artificial intelligence (AI) by providing technical capacity and expertise. Their recent work include serving for deep learning, model architecture redesign, AI for IoT and general streaming, and prediction or scoring confidence. Please refer to the following [resource](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/) for more information regarding CDL. 

### REFIT
The Center for Deep Learning is developing [REFIT](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/projects/refit/), a novel system that is built to consume and capitalize on IoT infrastructure by ingesting device data and employing modern machine learning approaches to infer the status of various components of the IoT system. It is specifically built upon several open source components with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and it is notably distinguished from other IoT systems in many regards. 

### Project Objectives

1. Develop and implement three IoT use cases based on public data.
2. Build and end-to-end solution for each use case on AWS, mimicking the general architecuture leveraged in REFIT. 
3. Assess the potential pros and cons of implementing a streaming-based solution in AWS versus REFIT. 

### Deliverables
1.  A comprehensive final report detailing the three IoT use cases, the end-to-end solution implemented in AWS, and a preliminary comparison between AWS and REFIT.
2. Source code and thorough documentation as provided in this GitHub repository.

## IoT Use Cases

### Divvy Bikes
A Chicago-based bike share system, Divvy Bikes provides an affordable and convenient mode of transportation throughout cities. The raw dataset provided publicly by Divvy contains information at the trip level, including the starting and ending station and time. The business objective revolves around predicting the number of trips at various stations for the next hour to facilitate resourceful restocking of bikes. The Divvy Bikes use case leverages an LSTM model to account for long-term seasonal dependencies to predict demand.

### Hard Drives
Servers comprise of hard drive disks aggregated together to form a storage pod. In particular, hard drives serve as the foundation for both the storage and retrieval of data through rotating disks. The relevant data are ammased by BackBlaze through the monitoring of various sensors in select hard drive disks. The ultimate objective involves the identification of hard drives that are close to failure to facilitate efficient predictive maintainance of server centers. More specifically, this particular use case capitalizes on an XGBoost framework to predict the useful lifetime of hard drives.

### MotionSense
The MotionSense data originates from an experiment involving 24 participants performing 6 activities across 15 trials in the same environment with fixed conditions. The activities comprise of moving upstairs, going downstairs, walking, jogging, sitting and standing. The dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements generated by sensors in the devices carried by the participants during the experiment. The MotionSense use case also implements an LSTM model for the primary objective: to predict the type of activity from the sensor readings.

### Solution Cost Estimation
The combined cost of the end-to-end AWS solution for the three use cases is estimated reach an **annual total of $3,207.22 USD** or equivalently, **$267.27 USD per month.** [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) are two of the more costly AWS services employed as part of the comprehensive solution. A detailed break down of the cost estimate by service can be found [here.](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=1af19374e566120b06e9ec56d5f4bd66c7c329d3)

## Final Remarks
The final scope and objectives of the project has transitioned slightly from the original proposal including the implementation of the three use cases on REFIT and designing a model agnostic feature selection algorithm for time series data. These works could serve as potential avenues for consideration for future projects with CDL. 

Finally, the ***final report*** detailing the entire 8 month project can be found in `/Deliverables` directory.
