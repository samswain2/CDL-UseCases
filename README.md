# IoT Use Cases: REFIT Practicum Project
This repository contains the implementation of IoT use cases using REFIT and cloud platforms for the Center for Deep Learning (CDL) Practicum Project.

# Overview
CDL's mission is to provide resources and expertise for companies seeking to establish or improve access to artificial intelligence (AI) and achieve proof of concept or deployment. The project focuses on developing and implementing IoT use cases using REFIT, a system designed to consume and capitalize on IoT infrastructure, and comparing it with cloud platforms.

For more information about REFIT, visit https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research/deep-learning/projects/refit.

# Objectives
1. Develop and implement 3 IoT use cases based on public data in REFIT
2. Implement the same use cases using one of the three big cloud providers
3. Design and implement a feature selection and engineering algorithm for time series data
4. Assess pros and cons of using REFIT vs cloud platforms

# Scope
- Implement the same 3 use cases in both REFIT and cloud platforms
- Develop and implement AI models for use cases
- Perform feature selection and engineering for time series data
- Create feature engineering algorithms for each use case

# Expectations
- Implement the project in Python or Scala
- Integrate feature engineering with the rest of REFIT
- Deliver feature engineering as a Docker container

# Contacts
- Point of contact: Borchuluun Yadamsuren
- Technical adviser: Diego Klabjan
- Supporting staff: Raman Khurana (post-doc at CD)
